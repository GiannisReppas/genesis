/**
 * @brief Make an educated guess on the number of threads to use for multi-threaded functionality.
 *
 * This function uses multiple sources and ways to try to guess a reasonable number of threads:
 *
 *  - If @p use_openmp is set, we use the `omp_get_max_threads()` function or the `OMP_NUM_THREADS`
 *    environment variable to get a number of threads, using the info_number_of_threads_openmp()
 *    function. For details, see there.
 *  - If @p use_slurm is set, we get a number of cores from the environment variable
 *    `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`.
 *  - Lastly, we get the result of `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()` as another hint.
 *    If furthermore @p physical_cores is set, and hyperthreads are enabled, we divide that hardware
 *    concurrency number by two, in order to account for hyperthreads, resulting in the number
 *    of physical cores available on the system (ideally). This avoids core oversubscription that
 *    could otherwise be the result of using all threads instead of all physical cores.
 *
 * If the numbers disagree with each other, we prefer OpenMP over slurm over `hardware_concurrency()`,
 * that is, we are going from most specific to least. Furthermore, if the OpenMP based guess yields
 * exactly the same number as the hardware concurrency, we also use the @p physical_cores setting,
 * as this result usually indicates that OpenMP left at its default, in which case we also want
 * to avoid core oversubscription due to hyperthreading.
 *
 * The function is guaranteed to return a non-zero value, meaning that at least the main thread
 * is always accounted for. This is important for Options::get().init_global_thread_pool(), which
 * will account for that, and initialize the number of additional threads to one fewer than this.
