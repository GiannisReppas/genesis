 * @brief Select a random sample following a multinomial distribution.

 * This function computes a random sample formed by @p n trials from an underlying distribution @p p.
 * The values in @p have to be non-negative, and are taken as weights of each category; they do not
 * need to be normalized to sum to 1. The function models drawing from multiple categories, each
 * with probability as given in @p p, with replacement.
 * See multivariate_hypergeometric_distribution() for the equivalent distribution to draw
 * _without_ replacement instead.
 *
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution for a description of the distribution.
 * See https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/randist.html#the-multinomial-distribution for
 * details on the distribution and the used algorithm, which follows C.S. Davis, "The computer
 * generation of multinomial random variates", Comp. Stat. Data Anal. 16 (1993) 205â€“217.
