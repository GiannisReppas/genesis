/**
 * @brief Compute the sign matrix or Sequential Binary Partition (SBP) of a Tree.
 *
 * The Tree has to be rooted and strictly bifurcating. Then, we can compute a matrix that tells for
 * each node a relative ordering of the other nodes. Say we have the tree:
 *
 *            /----------- T3
 *      /-----| N2
 *     |      \----------- T2
 *     | N1
 *     |
 *      \----------- T1
 *
 * This yields the (compressed) sign matrix:
 *
 * Taxa | T1 | T2 | T3
 * :--- |---:|---:|---:
 * N1   | +1 | -1 | -1
 * N2   |  0 | +1 | -1
 *
 * That is, all nodes in the subtree of the first child of a node get assigned a `+1`,
 * and all nodes in the subtree of the second child get a `-1`. The remaining nodes (the rest of
 * the tree, including the node itself) get assigned a `0`.
 *
 * This was introduced as Sequential Binary Partition (SBP) in [1], and called Sign Matrix in [2].
 * See there for more details.
 *
 * By default, the matrix dimensions are `n*n` with `n` beging the number of nodes in the tree.
 * That is, all node indices are used. This is easierst to work with in the context of other
 * functions that used node indices. However, the matrix contains a lot of zeros.
 *
 * If however @p compressed is `true`, the matrix is not indexed by the node indices.
 * Instead, the rows only contain inner nodes, and the columns only contain leaf nodes,
 * as shown in the table above. That means that the sign of inner nodes is not available in the matrix.
 * Use inner_node_indices() to get the node indices that correspond to the rows of the matrix,
 * and use leaf_node_indices() for the node indices that correspond to the columns.
