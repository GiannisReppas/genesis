 *
 * These settings are used by DiversityPoolCalculator, and for example by theta_pi_pool(),
 * theta_watterson_pool(), and tajima_d_pool(), in order to have them in a central place,
 * and avoid ordering confusion of function arguments, that would result from having to provide
 * them individually.
 *
 * Note in particular the setting `with_popoolation_bugs`: There are two major bugs (as far as
 * we are aware) in the PoPoolation implementation:
 *
 *  1. They compute the `n_base` term based on poolsize alone, and do not take the coverage into
 *     account at all.
 *  2. They do not use alpha star, but set it to be equal to beta star instead.
 *
 * Using this option, one can voluntarily activate these bugs here as well, in order to get
 * results that are comparable with PoPoolation results.
