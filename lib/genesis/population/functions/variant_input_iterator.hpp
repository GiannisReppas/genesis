 * with make_sample_filter() based on sample names. However, as Variant does not store the names
 * itself, those might need to be accessed from the VariantInputIterator data() function,
 * which yields a VariantInputIteratorData object.
 *
 * Using this to filter samples by their name is likely somewhat slower than doing it direclty
 * in the parsers, which we also offer. However, this way offers a unified and simple way to achieve
 * the filtering, as it is applied down the line, and hence can be used on any VariantInputIterator.

/**
 * @brief Helper function to check that some Variant input is sorted properly.
 *
 * The function creates a `std::function` that can be used with a VariantInputIterator to check
 * the order (and length) of the Variant%s being processed.
 *
 * By default, the different types of VariantInputIterator%s that we create for different file types
 * with the `make_variant_input_iterator_from_...()` simply iterate over their respective input
 * files as they are. However, we might want to check that their order is correct, or that their
 * lengths fit our expectation.
 *
 * This function by default checks this, using lexicographical order for the chromosomes, and
 * numerical order for the positions within chromosomes. This however might not always be the order
 * as present in the input source. In order to provide a custom order, the function optinally takes
 * a @link ::genesis::sequence::SequenceDict SequenceDict@endlink, which is used for the order
 * instead. See there for details on how to create such a dictionary from, e.g., `.fai`, `.dict`,
 * or reference genome `.fasta` files.
 *
 * Furthermore, when a @p sequence_dict is provided, using the @p check_sequence_lengths, we can
 * also check that the positions within each chromosome that we encounter in the input source fit
 * with the expectations of that dictionary. This serves as an additional sanity check of the
 * input files.
 *
 * If any of these checks fail, an exception is thrown.
 *
 * Exemplary usage:
 *
 *     // Get a sequence dict from a fai file
 *     auto sequence_dict = read_sequence_fai( from_file( fai_file ));
 *
 *     // Create a VariantInputIterator, for example from a sync file
 *     auto variant_iterator = make_variant_input_iterator_from_sync_file( sync_file );
 *
 *     // Add the observer that checks order, using a
 *     variant_iterator.add_observer(
 *         make_variant_input_iterator_sequence_order_observer(
 *             sequence_dict, true
 *         )
 *     );
 *
 *     // Use the iterator as usual.
 *     for( auto const& variant : variant_iterator ) {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *
 * @see See @link ::genesis::utils::LambdaIterator::add_observer() LambdaIterator::add_observer()@endlink
 * for the function of the underlying iterator that accepts the returned function from here.
 *
 * @see make_variant_input_iterator_from_vector(),
 * make_variant_input_iterator_from_sam_file(),
 * make_variant_input_iterator_from_pileup_file(),
 * make_variant_input_iterator_from_sync_file(),
 * make_variant_input_iterator_from_frequency_table_file(),
 * make_variant_input_iterator_from_pool_vcf_file(),
 * make_variant_input_iterator_from_individual_vcf_file(),
 * make_variant_input_iterator_from_variant_parallel_input_iterator()
