 * such as the file name and the individual sample names.

 * to achieve this. For example, use the `make_variant_input_stream_...()` functions to get such
 * an interator for different input file types.
 *
 * The stream furthermore offers a data field of type VariantInputStreamData, which gets
 * filled with basic data about the input file and sample names (if available in the file format).
