// =================================================================================================
//     Variant Gapless Input Stream
// =================================================================================================

/**
 * @brief Stream adapter that visits every position in the genome.
 *
 * The iterator takes some other VariantInputStream as input. It then iterates _all_ positions
 * in the chromosomes of that input, starting at 1, and until the last position per chromosome
 * of the input. All positions where the input does not have data (missing) instead dereference to
 * a dummy Variant that is set up with the same number of samples as the input, but zero counts.
 *
 * If additionally a reference genome or sequence dictionary is provided, the chromosomes are further
 * iterated for the full length as specified in these references. This expects that the input data
 * does not contain positions beyond the reference (otherwise, an exception is thrown), and we also
 * check that the reference genome bases are compatible with the bases provided by the input data
 * (the Variant::reference_base).
 *
 * Furthermore, if a reference genome or sequence dictionary is provided, and iterate_extra_chromosomes()
 * is set to `true` (which it is by default), we also iterate any chromosomes that appear in the
 * reference but not in the input data at all (of course, all of them will then only contain missing
 * data). This makes sure that the full reference is iterated over.
 *
 * In some cases, the Variant stream is intended to be subset to particular genomic regions.
 * For this, use genome_locus_set() to set a list of the regions to subset to. Note though that
 * our current implementation here is slightly inefficient, as we here still first attempt to fill
 * in the gaps in the input to some degree, only to then throw them out again if they are to be
 * removed by that region filter. This is unfortunate, but a more efficient implementation
 * that just skips all those regions in the first place turned out to be quite involved due to the
 * interactions between the data stream, reference dict, and region filters, and we did not attempt
 * to make this work for now. The current implementation is however still slightly more efficient
 * than applying the region filter afterwards, as we are at least able to skip part of the process
 * for the filtered positions.
 *
 * The iterator is useful in siutations where input is expected to have missing data, so that it's
 * skipped by its iterator, but some external algorithm or processing wants to use all the positions.
 * For instance, when writing a sync file, this can be used to make a "gsync" file that contains
 * all positions, instead of skipping missing data positions.

     * (in that case, doing a gapless iteration on top of SNP filtering wouldn't make sense in the
     * first place anyway).

     * This is recommended in order to avoid unnecessary computations when subsetting the

     * happen: On the one hand, if the input stream was already subset to some regions, then this
     * gapless iterator would re-introduce any positions that were previously removed, but with
     * missing data, which is likely not what we want. On the other hand, if the subsetting to
     * regions was done after using this gapless iterator, a lot of uncessary positions would first
     * be iterated, only to then be removed again if they are not in the required regions.
     *
     * So instead, setting the region filter here already makes sure that we only iterate the
