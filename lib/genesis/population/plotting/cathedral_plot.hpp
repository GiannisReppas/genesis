/**
 * @brief Template function to compute the value matrix for a cathedral plot, given a recored
 * with plot properties and per-position data to accumulate per window.
 *
 * The function computes the accumulated values across windows for each pixel in a cathedral plot,
 * which can then be visualized as a heat map.
 *
 * The function expects a cathedral plot @p record, containing data needed to compute the values
 * per pixel. It expects @p record to contain an iterable container `std::vector<Entry> entries`
 * whose contained elements have a member `position`, and also contain the data that is needed
 * by the @p accumulator. See FstCathedralPlotRecord for an example.
 *
 * The @p accumulator needs to have functions `accumulate()` and `dissipate()` that each take an
 * element of the @p record entries.
 * These functions are meant to accumulate values, and then un-do this again, which is what we use
 * to speed up the computation here. Also, the @p accumulator needs to have a `aggregate()`
 * function that uses the currently accumulated data to compute the value for a given window.
 * See FstCathedralAccumulator for an example. We take this as an (optional) argument, so
 * that it can be set up with other properties as needed.
 *
 * @see See compute_fst_cathedral_matrix() for an applied version of this function,
 * and see compute_fst_cathedral_data() for a function to compute @p record for that case.
