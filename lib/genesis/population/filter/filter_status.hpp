/**
 * @brief Tag class to assign a filter status to a Variant or SampleCounts.
 *
 * This class provides a 32bit uint as a status tag or indicator to keep track of whether a sample
 * or a position passed all filters, or, if not, which filter failed. It is initialized to 0,
 * meant to indicate that the data is good and to be used. Any value other than 0 shall be
 * interpreted to mean that this data does not meet certain criteria (it did not pass a filter),
 * and is hence to be ignored in any downstream computations and analyses. This is used in some of
 * the filters and processing.
 *
 * The status can be set() once, but has to be reset() afterwards if a different value is needed.
 * This is meant as a protection to accidentally overwrite the filter status when a filter has
 * already been considered to not pass. Hence, when testing and applying a filter, the status needs
 * to be checked before, so that new filters are only applied to data that are yet still passing.
 *
 * We currently offer the value to be general as far as the data is concerned, meaning that the
 * interpretation of any value other than 0 is left up to the user. However, for the filter
 * functions that offered here, we use the VariantFilterTag and SampleFilterTag enums, and
 * recommend to stick to this as well, unless extra filter types are needed.
