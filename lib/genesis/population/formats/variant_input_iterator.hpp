 * such as the file name and the individual sample names.

 * It offers to iterate a whole input file, and transform and filter the Variant as needed
 * in order to make downstream processing as easy as possible.
 *
 * This is useful for downstream processing, where we just want to work with the Variant%s along
 * the genome, but want to allow different file formats for their input. Use this iterator
 * to achieve this. For example, use the `make_variant_input_iterator_...()` functions to get such
 * an interator for different input file types.
 *
 * The iterator furthermore offers a data field of type VariantInputIteratorData, which gets
 * filled with basic data about the input file and sample names (if available in the file format).
 * Use the @link utils::LambdaIterator::data() data()@endlink function to access this data
 * while iterating.

 * @see @link utils::LambdaIterator LambdaIterator@endlink for usage and details.
