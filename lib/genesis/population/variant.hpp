/**
 * @brief A single variant at a position in a chromosome, along with BaseCounts for a set of samples.
 *
 * Typically, this class is used as a general representation of the variants/SNPs at a given
 * chromosome position, for example coming from a line in a VCF file or (m)pileup file.
 *
 * The class consists of the following data fields:
 *
 *   * A chromosome and position, 1-based.
 *   * The reference base and alternative base at that position (which might not always be available
 *     in the input file format, in which case we use 'N'). Note that we currently only support
 *     one alternative base here, that is, biallelic variants only.
 *   * A set of BaseCounts%s, that is, information on the counts of nucleotide bases of thereads
 *     of a set of pool samples or individuals that cover this variants/SNPs at that position.
 *     See BaseCounts for details on the latter.
 *   * A filter status to indicate whether this Variant is to be considered in analyses or not.
 *     See FilterStatus for details.
