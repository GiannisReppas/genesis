/**
 * @brief %Window over the chromosomes of a genome.
 *
 * This class is a container for the Window::Data (of template type `D`) that is produced when
 * sliding over the chromosomes of a genome in windows, or filling genomic region windows.
 * It is for example produced by the SlidingWindowIterator class (and the deprecated
 * SlidingWindowGenerator).
 *
 * We here define a window to have a first_position() and a last_position() that can be set
 * independently of the content of the window. For example, for a sliding window, they would
 * be determined by the width and stride of the slider. Within that window, entries can be added,
 * as for example found in a variant call file, or other data type along the genome.
 *
 * For example, we might have a Window between two positions `|` (e.g., determined by a sliding
 * window), filled with several entries `x` coming from the underlying data source like this:
 *
 *     -----|--------x-----x-xx---xxxx---xxxx-xxx----|-----
 *
 * The width() of the window then is the number of bases in the genome between the first_position()
 * and last_position(), that is, the distance between the two `|` (plus one, due to using inclusive
 * intervals), On the other hand, the span() of the window is the distance between the first and
 * last entry `x` in the window (again plus one).
 * Furthermore, the entry_count() or size() is the number of entries in that window, that is,
 * the total number of `x` in the window.
 *
 * **Remark:** We use 1-based inclusive intervals to denote genome regions. That means that the
 * numeric values returned from both first_position() and last_position() are both positions that
 * are part of the window.
 *
 * The class is mostly meant to be used to be read/iterated over, where the data is filled
 * in beforehand (e.g., via the SlidingWindowIterator), and can then be processed to compute some
 * values for the Window. That is, from the user side, the const access functions are mostly
 * important, while the non-const modification functions are chiefly meant for the code that fills
 * the Window in the first place.
 *
 * This means that data from an input file has to be copied into the Window first, which is a bit
 * of a waste, but, given that we might want to do things such as sliding windows with stride
 * smaller than window with, probably a necessary cost to have in order to keep the design simple
 * and easy to use.
