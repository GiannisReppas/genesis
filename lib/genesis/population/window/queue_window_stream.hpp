//     Queue Window Stream
// =================================================================================================

/**
 * @brief Stream for Window%s contaiing a queue of entries, i.e., sliding Window%s of a fixed number
 * of selected positions in a genome.
 *
 * With each step of the iteration, a window of entries of the underlying input stream is yielded.
 * The window contains count() many selected entries (entries that we want to consider), which is
 * based on the result of the user-provided entry_selection_function() functor. Any entries of the
 * underlying stream for which entry_selection_function() returns `false` are still included in the
 * windows, but do not count towards the total count() of entries that we want in the window. This
 * is meant as a way for instance to create windows of `n` SNP positions, while also being able to
 * retain all non-SNP entries, if they are needed for the downstream algorithm that is using the
 * windows.
 *
 * If no such extra positions should be included in the window (e.g., if we _only_ want the SNPs),
 * an approriate filter needs to be applied beforhand to the input stream, for instance by adding
 * it to the VariantInputStream that is typically used as input stream here, so that these entries
 * are removed already before being assembled into windows here.
 *
 * The way the windowing then works is as follows: Any window contains count() many selected
 * entries, as well as all not-selected entries that come _before_ each of these selected entries.
 * For instance, `x` marking selected (for which `entry_selection_function` returns `true`),
 * and `-` marking non-selected entries, and with non-overlapping windows of size 2
 * (`stride == count == 2`), we get the following windows:
 *
 *     ---x--x---x-xx---x-xx-x--x----x-x-x---x--
 *     [     ][    ][   ][ ][   ][     ][      ]
 *
 * where brackets mark each window as a closed interval. This is only considering entries based on
 * them being selected or not - their position on the chromosome is not considerered here at all,
 * which also means that any missing data does not affect this - it will just appear as jumps in
 * the positions when iterating the windows, but as this windowing approach here is not based on
 * these positions, there is no other effect.
 *
 * Notice the special last case here: the last window also contains the trailing non-selected
 * positions. This is done so that these positions are part of _some_ window. This is also the case
 * if the last window contains fewer entries than the count(), which happens if the number of
 * selected entries in the chromosome is not a multiple of the count() (which is very likely).
 *
 * The default helper functions to make an instance of this window stream,
 * make_default_queue_window_stream() and make_default_queue_window_view_stream()
 * set the entry_selection_function() so that _all_ entries are selected.
 * On the other hand, the specialized versions of these functions for underlying data of type
 * Variant, make_passing_variant_queue_window_stream() and
 * make_passing_variant_queue_window_view_stream() instead set the
 * entry_selection_function() so that only Variant%s are selected for which the Variant::status
 * is passing. Thus, for instance, if the underlying data stream has filters applied to it using
 * the VariantFilterNumericalParams, this can be used to filter for SNPs. See there for details.
 *
 * During the stream iteration, when incrementing the iterator, we move forward stride() many
 * entries, which can correspond to an arbitrary number of positions in the genome, depending on
 * how far the entries are spread out. Hence, any filtering on positions in the genome should be
 * done beforehand on the inputs, so that only those entries are used by this stream that are
 * meant to be selected.
 *
 * The four functors
 *
 *  * #entry_input_function,
 *  * #chromosome_function,
 *  * #position_function, and
 *  * #entry_selection_function
 *
 * have to be set in the class prior to starting the iteration, as well as the count() of how many
 * entries shall be used in each iteration.
 * All other settings are optional and/or defaulted to reasonable values.
 *
 * See BaseWindowStream for more details on the four functors, the template parameters,
 * and general usage examples of the class.
 *
 * For helper functions that take care of setting up this class for the most common use cases:
 * @see make_queue_window_stream()
 * @see make_default_queue_window_stream()
 * @see make_default_queue_window_view_stream()

 * This helper assumes that the underlying type of the input data stream and of the Window%s
 * that we are sliding over are of type Variant. It is hence a more specialized version of
 * make_default_queue_window_stream(). Here, we check the Variant::status, and only
 * select those Variants%s towards the QueueWindowStream::count() of each window That
 * have a passing FilterStatus. The QueueWindowStream::entry_selection_function is
 * set accordingly.
 *
 * @see make_passing_variant_queue_window_view_stream() wraps the returned stream in an
 * additional WindowViewStream.

/**
 * @brief Helper class that creates a QueueWindowStream with default functions for Variant
 * data, and wraps it in a WindowViewStream.
 *
 * See make_passing_variant_queue_window_stream() for the base functionality,
 * and see make_window_view_stream() for the wrapping behaviour.
 *
 * Note that because this is a simple wrapper around the constructor of QueueWindowStream,
 * we lose access to that class itself, so that its more specialized member functions cannot be called
 * any more. If this is needed, use the two aforementioned `make_...()` functions individually.
