The documentation of genesis consists of two main parts:
The **User Manual** and the **API Reference**.

## User Manual

The @subpage manual contains tutorials, code examples and high level explanations of the
functionality of genesis. It is intended for end users who want to use existing scripts and
applications, and for getting started with genesis.

## API Reference

The documentation of the application programming interface (API) is intended for users who want
to use genesis as a library or toolkit for their own applications.
It provides detailed references for the symbols defined in genesis:

 *  [Namespaces](namespaces.html)
 *  [Classes](annotated.html)
 *  [Source Files](files.html)

As the API Reference is generated from the doc-blocks in the C++ source code, it is mainly
oriented towards the C++ interface. It is however also suitable for the Python interface.
